        <h2>Detailed description</h2>
        
        <p>
            This project is related to subjective image quality assessment, applied on gray-level images,
            made in collaboration with Computational Sostainability Unit (CSU) of Univerity of Pavia. <br>
            There are different kind of images, that are falling into three different categories: <br>
                - Original: the images with no degradation; <br>
                - Impaired 1: the images with a small degradation; <br>
                - Impaired 2: the imaged with a heavy, and more visible, degradation; <br>
            All the used images are copyright free, so you can use them to perform other experiments and modify them. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In this section you can find both the image repository that we have generated, both
            some presentations that are showing some experiments results. <br>
            The image repository is organized in such a way that each subfolder is related to a different
            experiment, and in each one of them you can find three <br> 
            other folders that are related to the image categories we already discussed. <br>

        <p>
            Here you can find a link to a page that consists of a further experiment on subjective image
            quality assessment. <br>
            In this specific case the contribution is made by you (and other users that previously partecipated to it).<br>
            At the end you can also see insights that are related to all the evaluations.
