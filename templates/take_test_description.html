    <em>Welcome !</em>
    <br><br>
    In this form you're asked to rate the quality of thirty images,
   
    You can give each image a rating from 1 to 5 (1 stands for bad quality, 5 for 
    excellent quality).

    <br><br>

    You can find three different kinds of images: original, impaired1 and impaired2.
    
    <br>
    The impaired images are obtained from the 10 original ones, by applying two degradation algorithms, with a different
    <br> value of the impairment parameter for impaired1 and impaired2 sets of images.
    <br>
    Degradation on impaired1 images should be less visually noticeable than the one on the impaired2 images. 
    <br><br>
    Some easy rules you are pleased to follow:
    <br>
    - Observe all of the images under similar conditions: (viewing distance, brightness, artificial lighting, screen contrast);
    <br>
    - Give an evaluation for each image in a maximum time of 15 seconds; <br>
    - Wear contact lenses or prescription glasses, if you have an eye impairment; <br>
    - Please take the test only once. Since we care about your privacy, we have no way of knowing who took the test how many times, so we trust you on that!
    <br><br>

    All your answers (Opinion Scores, OS) will be used, with the one generated by other people, to calculate the MOS  
    <br> (Mean Opinion Score) on every single image and the overall MOS of the two different impairments.
    <br><br>

    It won't take long, less than 10 minutes of time.
    <br><br>

    We hope you'll enjoy taking the test, as much as we enjoyed preparing it!
    <br>
