<p>
    <em>Welcome !</em>
    <br><br>
    In this form you're asked to rate the quality of thirty images, in a range from 1 to 5 (1 stands for bad quality, 5 for 
    excellent quality), <br> by your personal opinion.   
    <br><br>
    You can find three different kinds of images: original, impaired1 and impaired2.
    <br>
    The impaired images are obtained starting from the original one and applying a degradation algorithm, with a different
    <br> impairment parameter value for both impaired1 and impaired2 set of images.
    <br>
    Degradation on impaired1 images should be less visually noticeable than the one on the impaired2 images. 
    <br><br>
    Some easy rules you are pleased to follow:
    <br>
    - Watch images under the same condition (brightness, artificial lighting, screen contrast);
    <br>
    - Keep constant the viewing distance; <br>
    - Give an evaluation for each image in a maximum time of 15 seconds; <br>
    - Wear the contact lenses or prescription glasses, if you have an eye impairment; <br>
    - Please do not cheat (for example moving from a section to previous one, after giving your opinion score; <br> 
    open this form with multiple accounts, if the person to give the opinion is always you), this will make <br>
    the final evaluation results incorrect.
    <br><br>
    All your answers (Opinion Scores, OS) will be used, with the one generated by other people, to perform the MOS 
    <br> (Mean Opinion Score) on every single image and the overall MOS of the two different impairments.
    <br><br>
    <!-- We'll do this or not?-->
    Furthermore, you have to login with your personal account in order to avoid that the same account responds multiple 
    <br>times to this form.
    <br><br>
    It won't take long, less than 10 minutes of time.
    <br><br>
    Hope you'll enjoy this evaluation session.
    <br><br>
