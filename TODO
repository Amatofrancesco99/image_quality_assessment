- Vote on whether to keep this repo and how to proceed.

- Write the static part of the website, presenting and describing the results of the former experiments. Possibly, in an appealing way.

- Write the part that dynamically produces graphs/dashboards from user-generated data.

- Write a privacy policy for this website and check out relevant laws, or ask Prof. (Important because we're handling emails and, potentially, other personal data)

- Improve the UIX/look-and-feel of the website. Make it prettier and more intuitive.

- Do some more error-handling.

- Write credits, general info, and other documentation. 

- Figure out a way to integrate GitHub with Pythonanywhere/or 
any other Python-back-end hosting service. For easier deployment.
